**Message:**
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am asking to redirect money away from the Huntsville PD and into the following social services: [LIST - Community Development, COVID Relief, Education, Parks & Recreation]. I request that an emergency meeting be called before the fiscal year goes into effect in order to deny the mayorâ€™s proposed budget and reallocate these funds to resources from which the citizens can benefit.

Thank you for your time,
